# Prisoner-s-dilemma
A school project based on the [prisoner's dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma)
Program a player (agent) to play a repeated non-cooperative two-player game. 
The input is a known payoff matrix, the number of repetitions may or may not be known in advance. 
The goal is to maximize one's profit, i.e., to get as many points as possible from the payoff matrix (sum over all iterations of all games).
